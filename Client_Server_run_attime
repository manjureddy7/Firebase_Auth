We will face this issue running both client and server in a single terminal
for that install concurrently package

if we have project structure like
client folder
package.json
server.js then

"client": "npm start --prefix client",    ----> goes one step down and runs in client 
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""   - ----> runs in single cmd
