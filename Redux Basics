Redux Complete way

Everything is store right? so import store first

import { createStore } from 'redux';

then we know that theres something called reducer where we will do all store manipulation, i mean which gives u state of the application
so create that ROOT REDUCER and 

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

In order to pass this data to our react components we need to import PROVIDER
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

then wrap our components inside it 

<Provider store={store} > <App /> </Provider>

here we are just passing the store as props to the main component.

Now Component wants to access data from store
then we have something called mapStateToProps this will give store as props
now u want to raise some actions to store then we have something called mapDispatchToProps

but how do we bind these two our component??? Dont worry we have something called Connect which is a higher order component. 
HOC are nothing but these take our componnets and wraps inside them and give component super powers.

connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(OUR COMPONENT)
