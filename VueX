Cheat sheet for VueX:

A Store file in VueX contains three parts
  1. State -> Actual state of the Application
  2. Mutuation -> If you want to change state change here, no other way dude
  3. Actions -> If you want to call backend or use User Interactions this is the only way from here call mutuation to change data.
thats it these three are the main ingredeients of the Vuex.
